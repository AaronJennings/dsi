### Notes for software carpentry workshop, Python session, 12/01/2017

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks for day 1 and day 2 of the python track for software carpentry at UCSF on 
december 12, 2017

This session was based on the "Plotting and Programming" tutorial from Software Carpentry.

I encourage everyone who took the class to review the lesson.  Some of the material will be new, and it will be useful to 
consolidate what you learned over the weekend.  

You may also want to take a look at another Software Carpentry python lesson,

We also covered pandas and graphing.  Because those lessons follow the software carpentry tutorial very closely, please 
refer to the tutorial for review.  

If you're interested in learning more, especially around Pandas, SQL, and JSON/web apis, please take a look at the other projects
in this directory, which contain code for previous workshops and programming sessions.
